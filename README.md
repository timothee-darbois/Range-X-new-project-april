these codes are also on OSF

to understand the name of the files: 
- preliminary analyses: analyses on seed weight and seed number
- single variable analyses: analyses on all the other traits
- germination: experiment : code about germination percentage, viability percentage and T50
- regreassion and PCA: code about PCA with all the traits, and regression between variables. This last part about variables is just a draft and does not run. (but the first part about PCA runs)
